description: "Bain Apartments Co-op is one of the most beautiful and interesting communities in Toronto. With 260 townhouse-style units influenced by the English Garden City Movement to include abundant green space, it is very much a 'village' within the city. The Bain has a rich history, with construction beginning in 1913, but became a housing co-operative in 1977."
