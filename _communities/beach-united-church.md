We have reduced our carbon footprint by completely renovating our building in 2013, installing rooftop solar panels which provide clean, renewable energy, designing our leading-edge permeable parking facility, using recycled materials, installed 6 EV chargers, planting more native species in our green space and adding pollinator gardens to increase biodiversity."
