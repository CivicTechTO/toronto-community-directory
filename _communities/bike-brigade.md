description: "The Bike Brigade is a group of 1000+ volunteer cyclists delivering food and other essentials by bike across Tkaronto (Toronto). We work directly with equity-seeking groups, food banks and other non-profits that are supporting vulnerable folks and underinvested communities in our city. We provide last-mile deliveries on behalf of our partners and work cooperatively to meet the needs of all community members."
