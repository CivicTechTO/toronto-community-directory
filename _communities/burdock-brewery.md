With string lights adorning the ceiling, and beer barrels perfect for perching, the space harkens back to a tavern with a modern spin. Built for live performance, this room lends itself to any style. Our programming showcases new and seasoned music, comedy, and storytelling from across Canada and beyond. Available for public performances, and private events, we aim to grow and foster community one patron at a time."
