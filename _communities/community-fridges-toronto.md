name: Community Fridges Toronto
description: "Community Fridges Toronto is a grassroots nonprofit organization that establishes and maintains accessible community fridges and pantries throughout Toronto. Founded during the COVID-19 pandemic, the initiative addresses food insecurity by providing free, 24/7 access to fresh food, produce, and non-perishable items in various neighbourhoods across the city. The organization operates on mutual aid principles, relying on community donations, volunteers, and local partnerships. Community Fridges Toronto has grown to operate multiple fridge locations, serving as both a practical food security solution and a model for community-led mutual aid."
