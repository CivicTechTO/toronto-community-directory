name: Danu Social House
description: "When we started Danu in July 2022, we imagined a place where you
  could spark a conversation with a stranger, stumble across new art and ideas,
  and lend support to the organizations fighting for a better Toronto; a bar in
  a living room. Several times a week we host free events that bring people
  together: book clubs, food pop-ups, fundraisers, game nights, art shows, our
  famous house parties, and more. We also offer free space for grassroots
  organizations like Encampment Support Network Parkdale, Climate Justice
  Toronto and The People's Voice to hold meetings and fundraisers."
