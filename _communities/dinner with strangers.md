name: "Dinner with Strangers"
description: "Dinner With Strangers is a monthly in-person dinner inviting people to ditch the small talk and instead ask good, gutsy questions. Join me and twelve other strangers for dinner - with the only rule being no work talk, I'll guide us through the questions that get us talking about where we're at, what we're learning, and what we care about."
