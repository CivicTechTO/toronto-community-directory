name: DROM Taberna
description: DROM Taberna is a heartfelt homage to places that we came from,
  have traveled to, or have never been - the lands that stretch from the Baltic
  to the Balkans to the Black Sea. Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Latvia, Lithuania,
  Estonia, Belarus, Czeska Republika, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Moldova,
  Serbia, Croatia, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, Montenegro, Macedonia,
  Bulgaria, Georgia. The golden thread that ties this soil together is the
  Romani people. From the deserts of India, over mountain and sea in their
  westward journey, the gypsies brought the traveller spirit to many gadjo. That
  is us, finding community amongst strangers, joy in the face of adversity,
  immigrant souls eating, drinking and playing music together.
