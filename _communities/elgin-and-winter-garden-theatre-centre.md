name: Elgin and Winter Garden Theatre Centre
description: "The Elgin and Winter Garden Theatre Centre is the last operating double-decker theatre in the world and a National Historic Site of Canada. Built in 1913 by theatre impresario Marcus Loew, it features two opulent stacked theatres: the 1,500-seat downstairs Elgin Theatre and the 1,000-seat upstairs Winter Garden Theatre, which is decorated with real beech boughs and hand-painted garden scenes. Owned by the Ontario Heritage Trust, the theatres were meticulously restored in the 1980s and now host a variety of performances including theatre, comedy, concerts, and film screenings, preserving an extraordinary piece of theatrical history."
