description: "Estonian Music Week places the creativity, virtuosity and heritage of two northern musical landscapes centre stage in Toronto, Canada. Founded in 2018 by the Museum of Estonians Abroad (VEMU) to mark the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Estonia, EMW has grown into the largest Estonian cultural event in Canada. This bi-annual festival spotlights contemporary and traditional music from Estonia and Canada."
