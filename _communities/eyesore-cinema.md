description: This is a real place, an actual, tangible environment where human beings
  interact in person. A place where knowledge is exchanged, opinions are debated and
  relationships are born. Sure, you can live in a cultural vacuum of entitlement,
  virtual hedonism and solipsism... but for some, nothing can replace reality for
  true joy, edification and a sense of community! Oh, and we also have movies!
