name: Front Runners Toronto
description: We are a member of International Frontrunners, an affiliation of LGBTQ+ running and walking clubs that have organized in many of the larger cities around the world. Inspired by Patricia Nell Warren's novel The Front Runner. The first Front Runners club began in San Francisco in 1974, and others quickly began forming in the United States, then in Canada and abroad. Today there are over a hundred Frontrunners clubs around the world.
