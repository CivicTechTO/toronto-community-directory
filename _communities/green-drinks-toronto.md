name: Green Drinks Toronto
description: "We will have a lively mixture of people from NGOs, academia, students, government and business. Come along and you'll be made welcome. Just say, 'are you green?' and we will look after you and introduce you to whoever is there. It's a great way of catching up with people you know and also for making new contacts. Everyone invites someone else along, so there's always a different crowd, making Green Drinks an organic, self-organising network."
