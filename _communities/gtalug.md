description: GTALUG, formerly called TLUG, helps unite Toronto area Linux users. Since
  the early 1990s, GTALUG has provided a common forum to exchange information pertaining
  to Linux and other open source software and operating platforms. Members meet regularly
  at our F2F (in person) meeting locations, participate in our email discussion list,
  and use the resource facilities of this website. Through participation in the GTALUG
  forums, and the use of the GTALUG resources, we combine our efforts to both teach
  and disseminate information, allowing us to better understand and control the open
  source world we are using, building and promoting to others.
