description: "The Humber River Pals emerged as a response to the litter problem along the riverside. Together we are all taking care of the environment and strengthening community bonds. Our mission is to organise regular ravine cleanups to reduce the amount of litter in our ravine system while introducing the beauty and history of the Humber River to the neighbourhood of Weston."
