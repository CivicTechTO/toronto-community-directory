name: Leslieville BIA
description: "Established in 2013, the BIA is comprised of restaurants and cafes, bars, retail shops and boutiques, and a range of service-providing businesses. Minutes to the downtown core yet just far enough away to feel like a whole new world, Leslieville has a rich history dating back to the 1800s and is host to many fantastic green spaces, some of the finest dining in the city and unique shops along the busy Queen Street strip."
