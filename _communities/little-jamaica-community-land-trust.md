name: Little Jamaica Community Land Trust
description: "Little Jamaica has been a vibrant Afro-Caribbean cultural district for more than half a decade. The risk of displacement from transit development was the catalyst for creating LJCLT, to prevent the cultural erasure of this historic Black community. Since 2020, BUTO has actively supported the Little Jamaica community, focusing on protection and upliftment. LJCLT grew out of our Pathways to Community Ownership initiative, with an aim to increase community property ownership. Building resilience using an Afrocentric lens, functioning as a Black-led and Black-serving community land trust."
