description: "We are a network of pro-housing voices from across the political spectrum that are committed to counterbalancing the anti-housing agenda that dominates Toronto's politics and has created an affordability crisis across the income spectrum. We aim to end the culture of small thinking that dominates Toronto's contemporary housing policies. We advocate reforms to increase our city's ability to build market and non-market housing supply, alongside demand reforms to encourage beneficial housing investment."
