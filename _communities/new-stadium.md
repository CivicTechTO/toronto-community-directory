description: "New Systems is a creative collective based in Toronto that brings together technologists, artists, and curious makers to explore what's possible when disciplines intersect. Their physical space downtown, New Stadium, is designed to improve how people learn and make new things. It focuses on two key processes: how quickly individuals or groups can gain knowledge, and how effectively they can turn that knowledge into real-world outcomes."
