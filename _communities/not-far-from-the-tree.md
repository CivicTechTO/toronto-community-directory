name: Not Far From The Tree
description: "Not Far From The Tree is Toronto's fruit tree harvesting program, founded in 2008. We pick fruit in people's yards – what we call Toronto's urban orchard – and share the bounty with organizations that feed fellow Torontonians. When a tree owner can't keep up with their harvest, we mobilize a volunteer team to pick the fruit, and then split it: 1⁄3 to the tree registrant, 1⁄3 split amongst the volunteers, and 1⁄3 donated to one of our community agency partners."
