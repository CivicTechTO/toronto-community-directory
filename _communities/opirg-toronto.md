description:
  OPIRG Toronto is an intersectional grassroots volunteer-based group at
  the University of Toronto, with a mandate for action, education, and research on
  environmental and social justice issues. We seek to empower and educate students
  and community members by building connections and providing opportunities for students
  to connect with community activism and vice versa. We also provide a forum for learning
  and sharing skills, and give people the tools and opportunity to work coÂ­operatively
  for social and environmental change.
