name: Practical Philosophy Club - Ontario
description: "The goal of the Practical Philosophy Club is to create a community that is open discussing ideas that can be used practically in everyday life. Our discussions help us develop the following: Critical Thinking / Discernment - through our conversational exploration, we question our own beliefs, and hear perspectives that can help us develop new insights. Communication - By sharing our thoughts, we are developing our communication ability, and learning how to share in a way that is understandable and accessible to people who may not have the same belief. Community - By having our discussions focused on a specific topic each week, we are able to get to know each other beyond small talk."
