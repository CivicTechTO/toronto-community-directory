name: Repair Café Toronto
description: Repair Café Toronto is a grassroots, volunteer group that organizes events where neighbours help neighbours learn how to repair. Our events are hosted by local community centres, branches of the Toronto Public Library and other community-based organizations. The video below was filmed at a recent Repair Café event. You can meet some of the volunteers and fixers, and see what it’s like to visit a Repair Café.
