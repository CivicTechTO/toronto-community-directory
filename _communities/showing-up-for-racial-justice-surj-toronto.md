name: Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) Toronto
link: https://www.surjtoronto.com/
description:
  SURJ Toronto is a GTA-based grassroots organization, and a local chapter
  of SURJ National (US). We collaborate with Black, Indigenous, and racialized organizers,
  and move white people to take action to dismantle white supremacy and colonialism.
  SURJ Toronto gives members and supporters opportunities to learn, develop skills,
  deepen political analysis, build accountable relationships, and redistribute resources
  to Black, Indigenous, and racialized communities.
