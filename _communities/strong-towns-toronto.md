name: Strong Towns Toronto
description: "Strong Towns is replacing North America's postwar pattern of development, the Suburban Experiment, with a pattern of development that is financially strong and resilient. We advocate for cities of all sizes to be safe, livable and inviting. We elevate local government as the highest level of collaboration for people working together in a place, not merely the lowest level in a hierarchy of governments."
