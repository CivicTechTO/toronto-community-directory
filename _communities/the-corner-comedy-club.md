name: The Corner Comedy Club
description: Toronto's intimate basement comedy club that has been a comedy institution since 2015. Originally setting the bar for indy comedy clubs in the city, this club has been a home for local rising stars and veteran comics looking to flex or work out new material. The Corner has been the place showcasing the wealth of local talent for nearly a decade. Open mic nights are popular and loosely booked, welcoming newbies and up and comers to join club regulars and pros on the Corner stage. The club accommodates a maximum of 50 guests in its cozy basement space with vinyl-lined walls.
