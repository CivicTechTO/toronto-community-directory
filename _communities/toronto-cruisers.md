description: '[cycling] What''s this all about? Experiencing the streets throughout
  Toronto! It''s about fun with no political affiliation or agenda. This is our love
  letter to the city - an adventure around Toronto where the route changes every week.
  We have a few favourite haunts & trails we like to visit, but we love to switch
  it up. If you like FUN and ADVENTURE & have a good attitude, you should join us!'
