description: "From the humble beginning of only 27 teams participating in the first festival back in 1989, the Toronto International Dragon Boat Race Festival has evolved into one of North America's premier dragon boat events. Organized by the Toronto Chinese Business Association in collaboration with GWN Dragon Boat, the Festival promotes the tradition and sport of dragon boating, enhances awareness of Asian and Chinese-Canadian cultures, and strengthens cross-cultural understanding."
