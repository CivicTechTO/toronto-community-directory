description: The Toronto Sunday Contact Jam has been running continuously for 35+ years, celebrating contact improvisation every Sunday from 10:30 am to 1:30 pm. Contact Improvisation is a partner/solo/group-improvised dance style developed in 1972, heavily influenced by Aikido and Modern dance. Regular meetings of contact improvisation dancers take place where dancers of all levels dance and observe. The space at Dovercourt House third floor is described as inspiring - one of the most beautiful dance spaces in North America with lots of natural light and a smooth dance floor.
