description: "Winter Stations is an international design competition held annually in Toronto since 2015. Artists, architects, designers, and students reimagine lifeguard stations as interactive public art installations, transforming city beaches into an open-air exhibition each winter. The six-week exhibition draws thousands of visitors to Woodbine and Kew beaches."
