  In the beginning there was Disco … and we are the Disco Descendants!
  Our parties are for families, and carers with kids. Life changes when you become
  a parent, so if you miss hitting the clubs and going out dancing, then our family-friendly
  day raves are for you. This is a social experiment. This is a conceptual art project.
  This is business. This is pleasure. This is culture. This is our party and you’re
  invited.
