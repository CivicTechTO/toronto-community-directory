description: In the beginning there was Disco … and we are the Disco Descendants! Our parties are for families, and carers with kids. Life changes when you become a parent, so if you miss hitting the clubs and going out dancing, then our family-friendly day raves are for you. This is a social experiment. This is a conceptual art project. This is business. This is pleasure. This is culture. This is our party and you’re invited.
